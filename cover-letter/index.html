        <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        <p>
          I come with great interest in being part of your team.
          I am currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts in History, with a Minor in Information Technology at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
          Presently, my cumulative GPA is 3.94.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides rich academic and working experiences in customer service, research, and administration, my life so far has endowed me with a variety of skills,
          complemented by a strong work ethic ready for implementation in a new role.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Extra Help Assistant position with UA Little Rock Health Services calls for the instillation of some skills, such as client relations, multitasking, and office administration
          through assisting in patient intake, insurance verification, and appointment setting.
          This position boosted my power of effective communication and the ability to work in a team within a busy environment for quality service delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          My archival fellowship at the Clinton Presidential Library allows me to be practically engaged in research, digitization, and document processing
          that requires a great amount of detail, flexibility, and organizational skills.
          I also judged in the National History Day Regional Competition where the opportunity to mentor and support young historians in their projects
          increased my commitment to community involvement and mentorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proficient in both Microsoft Office and Google Workspace, fluent in both English and Filipino, and committed to continuous learning.
          I am confident that my background and skill set will enable me to make meaningful contributions to your organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering my application.
          I would be pleased to explain in detail how my experiences and skills meet your requirements.
          Please find me at your convenience by calling me at (501) 291-8650 or at aurieldc@outlook.com.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Auriel Del Carmen</p>
