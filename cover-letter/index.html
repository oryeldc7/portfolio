      <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>

      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

      <p>
        I am writing to show my interest in the opportunity at your organization. 
        I hold a Bachelor of Arts in History with a Minor in Information Technology from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, supplemented by an excellent academic record. 
        I bring a special blend of skills in research, information management, and communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        This combination of experience in healthcare administration and archival work has provided me with an especially strong background to help any team needing a careful and flexible worker.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked as an Extra Help Assistant at UA Little Rock Health Services. My responsibilities included communicating with patients, scheduling appointments, and maintaining HIPAA standards. 
        This position developed my ability to work in high-volume environments, focusing on office work and interpersonal relations. My technical skill also includes maintaining electronic records, which has helped me handle sensitive information with due care and accuracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used to be an Archival Fellow with the Clinton Presidential Library, where my main work pertained to archival processing: digitization, preservation, and Freedom of Information Act requests. 
        This further fine-tuned my critical thinking and attention to detail skills. Records demand accuracy, and access to any information should be readily available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides working experience, I took part in the organization of community events and judged the National History Day Regional Competition. 
        In this way, I managed to help a few young historians and provoke a love of learning among them. Each of these experiences has helped me hone my communication skills and commit more to educational and community projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am very grateful for the opportunity to bring my experiences in history, information technology, and customer service into your organization. 
        With such diverse experiences, along with a great commitment to learning, I feel very confident about being an asset to your team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my experience and skills match your needs. 
        Please reach out to me at (501) 291-8650 or by email at <a href="mailto:aurieldc@outlook.com">aurieldc@outlook.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Auriel Del Carmen</p>
